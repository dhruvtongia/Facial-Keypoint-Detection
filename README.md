# Facial-Keypoint-Detection

Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem.  Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. 
The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

1) Tracking faces in images and video
2) Analysing facial expressions
3) Detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
4) Biometrics / face recognition

There are 15 keypoints, which represent the following elements of the face:

left_eye_center, right_eye_center, left_eye_inner_corner, left_eye_outer_corner, right_eye_inner_corner, right_eye_outer_corner, left_eyebrow_inner_end, left_eyebrow_outer_end, right_eyebrow_inner_end, right_eyebrow_outer_end, nose_tip, mouth_left_corner, mouth_right_corner, mouth_center_top_lip, mouth_center_bottom_lip.
